# Robot Bjorn - an Arduino based open source robot #
By [Ramoonus](http://www.ramoonus.nl)

RobotBjorn is a Arduino based 4 wheel drive robot. 
It uses basic Arduino Shields and open source firmware (writting in C++, [Wiring](http://wiring.org.co/) and the client in [Processing](http://www.processing.org/))

Compatibility with third-party shields and platforms is described in the [Compatibility](compatibility.md) document.

RobotBjorn is named Bjorn, after [Asbj√∏rn A Mikkelsen](https://twitter.com/neslekkim)

## Donate ##
The Robot itself costs approx. 100 Euro but modifications and tutorial material costs much more.

## Software Toolkit ##
I used the following software for the development:

* Robot Firmware: [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software "Download Arduino IDE") 1.6.0
* Documents: [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/ "Download MarkdownPad") (for Windows)
* Schematics: [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/ "Download Fritzing") 
* Client: [Processing](http://processing.org/download/ "Download Processing") 2.0

Should be fully compatible with
* [Atmel Studio 6.1 update 2.0](http://www.atmel.com/microsite/atmel_studio6/ "Atmel Studio 6")  +  [Visual Micro](http://www.visualmicro.com/ "Visual Micro")
* [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software "Download Arduino IDE") 1.0.x
* Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers + AVR
* * Robot Firmware: [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software "Download Arduino IDE") 1.5.x
