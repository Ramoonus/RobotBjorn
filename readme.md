# Robot Bjorn - an Arduino based open source robot #
By [Ramoonus](http://www.ramoonus.nl)

RobotBjorn is a Arduino based 4 wheel drive robot. 
It uses basic Arduino Shields and open source firmware
The Robot costs approx. 100 EURO to make.

Compatibility with third-party shields and platforms is described in the [Compatibility](compatibility.md) document.

Future Development is specified in a [Todo](todo.md)

# Donate #
The Robot itself costs approx. 100 Euro but modifications and tutorial material costs much more.
